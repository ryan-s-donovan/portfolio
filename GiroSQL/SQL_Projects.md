## Build Script
The Giro data mart build script creates the "GiroDM" data mart if it does not exist, deletes tables if they exist, and creates dimension tables and the fact table with the appropriate attributes and constraints. Due to the logic, the script can be run multiple times without error.

## Bike and Snow Sales Analysis (Power Pivot)
### Chief Operating Officer's Question 
Giro specializing in snow sports means that sales should be higher in months before and during the wintertime in the US. The owner wants to know if this is true. What states have the most sales in these months?

	
### Dashboard
	
![Screenshot 2024-03-04 202849](https://github.com/ryan-s-donovan/portfolio/assets/159507460/071398d2-3b6e-420b-8d9e-b485fa13c4f7)


	
### Analysis
<br>Giro's sales are the highest during the winter months of January-April dipping down in the summer months and increasing in the early fall. January has the most purchases with 268 total. What is interesting is that Bike sales are actually higher than the Snow sales in the winter months. California has the most sales in the month of January, with Colorado trailing behind in 2nd place. 
	
### Recommendations 
<br>Bike sales are consistantly high. Snow sales need to increase. This means that the owner can do more advertising of its snow sport products to increase these sales.

## State Revenue (Power BI)
### Chief Marketing Officer's Question
The owner of Giro is interested in the total revenue generated by each state, along with the most popular month in which Giro makes the most sales. The owner is also very interested in finding out what city produces the most revenue in 2023 along with what season revenue is highest. 

### Dashboard
![Screenshot 2023-11-15 165804](https://github.com/ryan-s-donovan/portfolio/assets/159507460/7df76fd4-9b0f-4090-a84f-987e4abd9905)



### Analysis
Looking at the Total Revenue Statistics Dashboard, Giro’s total revenue in 2023 sits at about $13.4K. The highest amount of revenue produced in 2023 comes from California. The most revenue generated comes from Sacramento, CA. During the winter, specifically February, is when Giro sees the highest revenue out of all the seasons. 
<br>

### Recommendations
After using this dashboard for further analysis, I recommend Giro to really focus on these key locations for revenue generation. Sacramento California is the one of the sole producers of Revenue for the company, specifically during February. Winter seems to be a strong suit for California, so marketing during the off season could further improve revenue generation for this city and state. Marketing some of Giro’s warmer weather equipment, geared towards biking, will be very important in furthering revenue growth. Winter activities are spread out from top to bottom of California, so pushing the biking equipment at all locations of California will really be beneficial to see growth in the off season of winter sports. 

## Employee Sales Dashboard (Power BI #2)
### Chief Marketing Officer's Question
Employees have begun to ask for raises based on their performance. The owner wants to figure out the top 10 employees who make the most sales so that he can give them all raises. The owner is also interested in not only seeing how Giro’s sales are broken down by sport, but also the sport category in which the products are in.

### Dashboard #2
![Screenshot 2023-11-15 165856](https://github.com/ryan-s-donovan/portfolio/assets/159507460/1c71c3be-493f-415a-a9e2-bdf4257020ee)



### Analysis
Masha Gorch holds the highest amount of sales in the company at $1,962.90. She outperforms the 2nd runner up by over $200. Biking has the most sales, specifically the downhill/freeride category of the sport with $27,387 total sales since 2019. Snow sports see the most sales in the backcountry category, with $35,014 total sales since 2019. Bike Sports outperform Snow sport sales with $163,630 to $90,450. 
<br>

### Recommendations
To aid in the total sales produced by other employees, Giro should promote Masha Gorch to a senior position. In this position she can travel around to different Giro store locations to give sales lessons to other employees. This will further the skills of other employees while providing Masha with the raise she well deserves. On the other hand, Giro should look into enhancing the snow sport category of their business. The biking category seems to be doing fine, so focusing on snow sports will be beneficial when trying to increase sales among this sport.
